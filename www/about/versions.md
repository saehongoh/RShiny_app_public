## 1. BuyTheDips %>% dashboard versions

- The dashboard is constantly improving! I'm not a webdesigner or programmer by any means. Thank you for your patience!

\

### Version 1.3.0 | December 3rd, 2021.

- Happy Friday! We've had tons of traffic this week to the dashboard. It was a crazy week for the servers. Sorry if you've experiences outages.
- Added Mole's limits to the dashboard. 
- Enter your budget and Mole will suggest limit buy and sell points based on current z scores. They're essentially **!getspicy** of the twitter version, but the twitter version only updates every 20 minutes while the dashboard one updates every 5 minutes.
- People seem to really enjoy the animations on the main twitter bot. I'm trying to think of ways I can incorporate this into the website. 

\

### Version 1.2.2 | November 25th, 2021.

- Good news: Days since chart is should now be stable and reliable! 
- Most changes were made on the backend this week that increases performance and decreases loading time. In other words, I cleaned up my code lol.
- I added a 'full screen' option to the historical charts. 
- I've been working on the portfolio manager that uses BuyTheDip metrics. I'm pretty happy with how things are going, and I'm hoping that it'll help crypto investors and traders make better decisions. Let me know on Twitter if you'd like to be a beta tester for this feature when its ready.

### Version 1.2.0 | November 16th, 2021.

- Thank you all for your interest in the **BuyTheDips** dashboard! 
- I'm sorry that the server has been unstable. The cold-hard-truth is that I made the app on Amazon AWS free-trial server which has limited capabilities. I'm bashing on my keyboard as fast as I can.
- The initial release a week ago helped better understand server requirements moving forward. Unlike your traditional blog pages, the **BuyTheDips dashboard** app is actually quite CPU heavy with each user. So the server crashes/slows-down everytime there's an uptick of traffic.  
- To unload some server CPU usage, the historical charts were moved off the main app and they are uploaded every hour as *html widgets*. You can still filter them and scroll them, but you can't change their color anymore. 
- Few additional indicators and metrics were added (explained below).
- Features have become slightly more mobile friendly.
- I think I will be able to add even more cryptos in the future updates, but I think I will prioritize stabilitizing the server first.

\

### Version 1.0.0 | November 10th, 2021.

- Launched BuyTheDips dashboard.
- Dashboard updates automatically every 5 minutes. 
- 'Reset axis' button on plotly graphs resets the timeframe (x-axis) to 3 days, and 'Auto-scaling' button resets plot to 12 days. 
- While you can filter cryptocurrencies by either clicking on the panel at the top, or on the legends, only the top filter changes are sustainable through updates.

## 2. Future development/work-in-progress

\

### 2.1 Portfolio manager on BuyTheDips website is under development. 
- I'm hoping to make the best product that crypto investors have been looking for. It's coming soon, I promise. I'm coding as fast as I can. 

### 2.2 Machine learning based short-term predictions for z-scores 
- Mole has been learning cryptocurrency metrics and indicators. At some point, Mole will start sharing her predictions with us. Stay tuned!
