BuyTheDips started as a hobby project made to help with crypto investing. The core algorithm statistically determines what “dips” are in the popular saying “buy the dip” based on historical performance, thereby reducing ambiguity. Buying these dips and selling at these peaks will yield greater returns on your investment. Whether you sell or not at the peaks is entirely up to you, but a portfolio that buys at dips will definitely outperform a scheduled-time-purchases (e.g., DCA) by 6-20% depending on your "dip" threshold levels. Currently, BuyTheDips has three main information platforms: **The Dip Index** [**@BitcoinDips**](https://twitter.com/bitcoindips), and **The Dip Index** [**%>% dashboard**](https://buythedips.io/).

My goal is to provide traders decipherable metrics in the cryptocurrency market. I try not to influence people's financial decisions, make calls/predictions, or share my opinions on which coin is better than others.

\

## 1. The Dip Index %>% dashboard is running in beta

On the [**The Dip Index %>% dashboard**](https://buythedips.io/), you'll be have to grab live z-scores based on current price and trading volume. For archived updates on the dashboard please visit the **versions** page.

\

### Version 2.2.0 | January 9th, 2022.

I want to thank everyone for using the dashboard! I'm really happy that people are getting uses out of it. I'm getting tons of love and feedback on twitter and I am working towards implementing every single one of them. With that said, I'm just one guy and this is just side hobby for me so updates might take some time. 


##### **Frontend**:
1. Filter limit has been set to 12. It just works a little better when the app isn't trying to update 25 cryptos at once for all the connected users.
2. Added a top filter bar for cryptocurrency categories. This will look better as I add more cryptos to the platform.
3. Took out ALL the stupid google ads. They weren't paying that much, and it was significantly slowing down my website. So good bye Google!

##### **Backend**:
1. After awesome tweets by Adam (@abetrade) and Ryan (@CanteringClark), I realized that I needed to upgrade the servers yet again. I'm running c6g.2xlarge now and pretty satisfied so far. 

##### **Twitter**:
1. I'm getting rid of jpegs altogether now and just keeping the gifs. 

#### **Under development**:
1. I've been playing around with coinbase, binance, and crypto.com apis for orderbooks. I think I can roll out a new metric in the next update that will provide insight into market sentiment based on bids/asks. I think I will also make a new graph that will show buy and sell walls within z-score increments. Think it'll be fun.
2. I think the backend has been scaled enough to handle more cryptocurrencies now, so I will definitely add more in the coming weeks. Let me know on twitter if there are any that you absolutely want included into dashboard. 
3. I've gotten a suggestion on including a metric related to beta (slope). 
4. I've been suggestions to make tutorial videos on YouTube. I don't know if I'll have time for this. I will try to update the documentation in the meantime.  

\

### Version 2.1.0 | December 23th, 2021.

##### **Frontend**:
1. Added filter table to the dashboard.
2. Added graph tooltips/explanations to the dashboard (hover question marks).
3. Added longer duration to historicals (since Oct 30th, 2021 when I started tracking z-scores). 
4. Market cap dominance calculations have been updated to be more realiable. Now it's measured as change against bitcoin market cap.

##### **Backend**:
1. It's come to my attention that shiny apps are limited to one CPU worker per app. So I've been trying to scale up shiny app using shinyproxy/docker, but there was a weird callback bug with datatable module that specifically messed up the filter table. I think I've found a work-around for now by using nginx as a load balancer to multiple shiny apps. 
2. With that said, a helpful webdeveloper on twitter (@itsmlyup) has told me that it will be hard to scale my shiny app any further without rewriting everything from scratch with javascript! I will try to work on this in the coming weeks, but at the same time, I am realizing that I am way in over my head. 

##### **Twitter**:
1. I am changing the tweet frequency from every hour to every two hours. As the dashboard website gets more stable/usable, I will continue to change the twitter frequency. 
2. It seems like people are using the limit feature on the dashboard which makes Mole somewhat obsolete, so I am considering taken **Mole** offline. It's a little sad cause I think Mole is hilarious.

\

### Version 2.0.0 | December 16th, 2021.

- Renovated user-interface.
- Added a **voting page for twitter updates** (left panel menu > “VOTE”). Because I wanted to keep voting completely anonymous and you can actually vote multiple times over different sessions. Voting closes on the first of every month (2pm EST). 
- Added **correlation matrix** for price movements and trading volumes. Found in “Historical” tabs.
- Moved volatility graphs to their own tab.

\

### Version 1.3.1 | December 10th, 2021.

- A generous anonymous donor left me 5 ADAs this week! This is the single largest donation I've ever had and I am so grateful to your contribution! Thank you very much!
- I made some major upgrades on the backend that should improve user experience: 
1) Most calculations will occur off the shiny web app now, and it should speed up the website in the next 48 hours.
2) Upgraded AWS server to a compute-optimized instance (C6g). I tried T2, T4 and A1 EC2 instances so far and they were just really unreliable no matter how many CPU credits I was accumulating off peak hours. 
3) Implemented a proper web-app time-out procedure. The dashboard web app was not exiting properly after people disconnected from their phones, leaving the server connected to them indefinitely. So hopefully this fixes that. Timeout is 4269 seconds (~71 minutes) of inactivity, so most of you guys won't see this.
- We've held our first votes for twitter account page. I will hold these votes every 2-weeks so we have a consistent turnover of cryptos. I might code in a voting app on the dashboard so that people can vote anonymously. I will try to include coins that were mentioned but did not win into the dashboard.
- Some of you guys may have noticed that I started running ads. I hate it so much, especially the google's auto-ad placement. But I want this dashboard to become financially self-sustaining. No pressure but please feel free to click on them once in a while lol.

\

### Version 1.3.0 | December 3rd, 2021.

- Happy Friday! We've had tons of traffic this week to the dashboard. It was a crazy week for the servers. Sorry if you've experiences outages.
- Fixed the mobile navigation button blackhole.
- Added Mole's limits to the dashboard. 
- Enter your budget and Mole will suggest limit buy and sell points based on current z scores. They're essentially **!getspicy** of the twitter version, but the twitter version only updates every 20 minutes while the dashboard one updates every 5 minutes.
- People seem to really enjoy the animations on the main twitter bot. I'm trying to think of ways I can incorporate this into the website.

### 1.1 Dashboard plots


#### 1.1.1 z-score movements in the last 48 hours
- Displays historical z-scores (z-price) in the last 48 hours. The others, z-volume and performance, are available on the "Historicals" tab available on desktop.

\

#### 1.1.2 current performance on 14d volume adjusted average
- Shows how your crypto is performing currently when compared to the 14-day volume-adjusted moving average price. 

\

#### 1.1.3 z-score in current price (z-price)
- These are z-scores calculated on current price. See below for explanations on z-scores.
- Hover on cryptos to see Mole's suggestions on dips.

\

#### 1.1.4 z-score in current trading volume (z-volume)
- These are z-scores can be calculated on trading volume as well. The same guidelines apply. z-volume > 2.0 is volume that is significantly higher than expected, and z-volume less than -2.0 is significantly less. Calculated from historical 14 day moving averages of trading volume.

\

#### 1.1.5 scatter in price (z-price vs. z-volume)
- Scatter plot of items 1.1.3 and 1.1.4
- This is my new favourite way to see cryptos action now. 
- White box in the middle (x and y boundaries at -2 and 2) is essentially what I call **"the-safezone-of-stability"**. 
- If your crypto is in this zone, it's price and trading volume is as expected (e.g., regular, normal). 
- Once outside this box, and it starts moving towards each corners and/or quadrants, you may consider the following scenarios (with a grain of salt, of course):
1. Right top: Significant increase in volume, significant increase in price. Possible interpretation: large buying pressure outweighing sell limit pools. People may be FOMO buying?
2. Left top: Significant increase in volume, significant decrease in price. Possible interpretation: Large selling pressure (Panic sell?).
3. Left bottom: Significant decrease in volume, significant decrease in price. Possible interpretation: Price is decreasing, but volume is very low. Probably has something to do with liquidity pool (lack of buy limit orders).
4. Right bottom: Significant decrease in volume, significant increase in price. Possible interpretation: Price is increasing, but volume is significant low like quadrant 3. Some people say that you should never trust price movements that isn't accompanied by volume, especially if it's due to low pool liquidity.
- When a crypto starts to "**moon**", it'll first make significant lateral movement towards the right and then tread upwards into the to the right-top corner. 

\

#### 1.1.6 scatter in volatility (volatility in price vs. volatility in trading volume)
- Scatter plot of items 1.1.7 and 1.1.8
- Percent volatility (i.e., the tendency to change rapidly and unpredictably) is calculated on both crypto prices and trading volume, and then plotted against each other.
- the faded white boxes show IQR ranges for each metric. Where the boxes overlap in the middle, is where you expect % volatility values to be. Outside of this area indicates that current volatility is higher or lower than the norm. 

\

#### 1.1.7 and 1.1.8 volatility in price and trading volume
- Percent volatility (i.e., the tendency to change rapidly and unpredictably) is calculated on both crypto prices and trading volume.
- Presented as bar graphs.

\

### 1.2 Historical plots

- 2-week historical plots of z-scores of price and trading volume, and performance can be seen here.
- There is a little filtering bug with the embedded widgets. Please open up the full screen versions to filter down to your favourite crypto.
- Updates every hour.

\

### 1.3 Days Since

- Displays days since mooning or dipping.
- Please note that I started tracking crypto metrics on Oct 30th, 2021. So if it hasn't dipped or mooned since then, I don't have a value. Sorry.

\

### 1.4 Limits

- Using z-scores, Mole makes limit buys and sells suggestions and how buying or selling at these points would affect your breakeven scores (avg coin price; optional input). 
- Many of my early twitter followers will know this feature as Mole's !getspicy, but the backend data for the twitter version only updates every 20 minutes while the dashboard one updates every 5 minutes. I may implement !getdips as an option in the future.
- Current strategies available: unbiased, significant, laidback, bell, aggressive.

\

## 2. Features on Twitter

Documentation on **BuyTheDips** [**@BitcoinDips**](https://twitter.com/bitcoindips) and **Mole** [**@BitcoinDipsMole**](https://twitter.com/bitcoindipsMole) has been moved to [**here**](https://buythedips.io/aboutMole.html)

## 3. Brief explanation on BuyTheDips Metrics

\

### 3.1 z-scores based on **price** (aka z-price)

z-scores are current price metric calculated from trading volume-adjusted two-week moving averages and standard deviations. Google images for z-score, you'll see a nice bell-cruve of what the scores represent. In regards to crypto prices:

1. Z-score greater than **+2** means that the current price is significantly **HIGHER** than what's expected from the last two weeks. In this case, *you may consider ***selling** some coins to take some profits* assuming that your average cost per coin is lower than the current price. If you're looking to buy at z-score > 2, you will be paying a premium.

2. Z-score less than **-2** means that the current price is significantly **LOWER** than what's expected from the last two weeks. In this case, *you may consider ***buying** more coins as it is a good time to buy*, and prices may go back to norm. To be honest, I don't recommend that you buy every coin that dips below -2. Rather, pick a small number of coins you believe in and invest whenever it dips below whatever threshold you set. It will outperform DCA. Alternatively, refer to Mole's dips to set up z-score based buy limits.

3. Z-score between +2 and -2 means that the current price is very similar to the average price of last two weeks. In other words, the price is **fair** or **normal**. 

\

### 3.2 z-scores based on **trading volume** (aka z-volume) 

- The same metric can be calculated for trading volume, and the logic stays the same. Large sudden increases in trading volume will register as z-volume > 2.0, and sudden drops will register as z-volume < -2.0. Some investors believe that large movements in volume will precedes increases in price, though it's not always the case. I've actually more cases of the opposite (z-volume increase after z-price) which is an indication of either FOMO or rug-pull/large profit taking.


\

### 3.3 All this is cool but does following z-scores work?

- Surprisingly yes, it works pretty well but you have to be disciplined to some extend. Buying cryptos when z-scores are less than -2 or -3 can make you 6-20% additional returns on your investment. 
- Detailed information on how BuyTheDips makes more on your investment can be found [**here**](http://buythedips.io/zscore_investing.html).
